# Cypress E2E Tests – Saucedemo

This repo contains 3 Cypress test cases for [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/):

1. ✅ Successful login with valid credentials  
2. ✅ Add product to cart and verify  
3. ✅ Complete checkout and confirm order  

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

npm install
Run tests with Cypress Test Runner


2. npx cypress open
3. Go to Spec folder in Chrome runner where you will see the all 3 js files
4. One by one you can run the code and debug
You can also see the error/shape of the UI by hovering on code steps 

Notes:
1. For testing purpose and due to short version of assignment user credentials are hardcoded but for better code maintenance this can go to config file.
2. No other framework like POM and Cucumber are used due to time crunch.
